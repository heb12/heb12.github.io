# Privacy Policy
This is an explanation of the information we (Heb12 Bible Apps) collect about you, how, and why, regarding all of our services.

We do not intentionally collect or store any information via use of our services. However, under certain circumstances, some information may be sent to certain parties via usage of our applications and website.

### Heb12 Desktop
Heb12 Desktop will connect to the [NET Bible Webservice](https://labs.bible.org/api_web_service) to obtain the NET text (licensing issues prevent us from incuding the NET translation in Heb12 itself). This may cause your IP address to be stored by that party.

This program will also connect to GitHub's servers when you press the "Check for Updates" button.

### Heb12 Mobile
Heb12 Mobile will also connect to the NET Bible webservice for the same reasons as Heb12 Desktop.

### Heb12's Website
While visiting heb12.ml, there are many links which will take you to many different websites. You are subject only to their privacy policies.

    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the new website for Heb12. Our goal is to make a usable cross-platform Bible system. It will be difficult, but here are our plans.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Finish our desktop program</li>
      <li>Make a useable online version</li>
      <li>Make a backend to our systems that allows syncronization between different devices</li>
      <li>Make an Android app</li>
      <li>Make a Windows Store App</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some of those will require a lot of work and perserverance. We probably will not be able to finish them all, but we will at least make a desktop program and an online version. It would be great if we had a backend, and that will come next.</p>
    <p>We are a team of a couple programmers. <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/AmazingMech2418">AmazingMech2418</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/MasterOTheTiger">MasterOfTheTiger</a>. The latter started the project, but the former joined recently and has been very influential in the development, especially with the online version.</p>
    <p>Our apps will always be free (libre) and open source programs. Which means that anyone can view the code, help improve it, make their own version of it, and distribute either their own version or ours. The reason we do this is because we don't want to have control over <strong>your</strong> app. We give it to you and give you the freedom to do what you want to do with it. We do not spy on you, we do not restrict what you can do with the program, etc.</p>
    <p>Most importantly, we want the programs to honor Jesus through the work we do. Jesus gave us our talents, and we are using them to honor Him. </p>
    <h2>Use Our Products</h2>
    <p>You can try out our <a href="https://heb12.github.io/heb12-Online">online alpha</a> if you want. It does not work very well and we are putting a lot of work into making it operational.</p>
    <p>We currently have beta downloads available. They are stable, but incomplete. We have them available for Windows and Linux (we need someone to package it for macOS) at our <a href="https://github.com/heb12/heb12/wiki/Packages">Wiki page</a>. We are almost done and these are close to the finished version. We are releasing it in one to two weeks. </p>
    <h2>Stay Updated</h2>
    <p>Here are some ways you can stay updated with the development of our apps.</p>
    <h3>GitHub</h3>
    <p>We have a <a href="https://github.com/heb12">GitHub</a> setup for our apps. It is where we work and talk about the program. Here you can view the development of the program, study the documentation, and even help us if you want.</p>
    <h3>Twitter</h3>
    <p>MasterOfTheTiger often posts information about the progress of the program <a href="https://twitter.com/MasterOTheTiger">on Twitter</a>. You can follow <a href="https://twitter.com/MasterOTheTiger">MasterOfTheTiger</a> on Twitter or follow the tag #heb12.</p>

    <p>Welcome to the new website for Heb12. Our goal is to make a usable cross-platform Bible system. It will be difficult, but here are our plans.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Finish our desktop program</li>
      <li>Make a useable online version</li>
      <li>Make a backend to our systems that allows syncronization between different devices</li>
      <li>Make an Android app</li>
      <li>Make a Windows Store App</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some of those will require a lot of work and perserverance. We probably will not be able to finish them all, but we will at least make a desktop program and an online version. It would be great if we had a backend, and that will come next.</p>
    <p>We are a team of a couple programmers. Amazinigmech2418 and MasterOfTheTiger. The latter started the project, but the former is working hard at improving the existing systems (and is leading in the development of the online version).</p>
    <p>Our apps will always be free (libre) and open source programs. Which means that anyone can view the code, help improve it, make their own version of it, and distribute either their own version or ours. The reason we do this is because we don't want to have control over <strong>your</strong> app. We give it to you and give you the freedom to do what you want to do with it. We do not spy on you, we do not restrict what you can do with the program, etc.</p>
    <p>Most importantly, we want the programs to honor Jesus through the work we do. Jesus gave us our talents, and we are using them to honor Him. </p>
    <p>For you who want to contribute, we have a <a href="https://github.com/heb12">GitHub</a> setup. It is where we work and talk about the program. If you want to try out a version of our <a href="https://heb12.github.io/heb12-Online">online version</a> (which does not even work as of now), you can access it now.</p>

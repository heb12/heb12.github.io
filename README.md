# Heb12 Bible Apps
A project to make a usable cross-platform Bible system.

Hebrews 4:12:
  For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any double-edged sword, piercing even to the point of dividing soul from spirit, and joints from marrow; it is able to judge the desires and thoughts of the heart.

## About Us
Welcome to the new website for Heb12. Our goal is to make a usable cross-platform Bible system. It will be difficult, but here are our plans.

- Finish our desktop program
- Make a useable online version
- Make a backend to our systems that allows syncronization between different devices
- Make an Android app
- Make a Windows Store App

Some of those will require a lot of work and perserverance. We probably will not be able to finish them all, but we will at least make a desktop program and an online version. It would be great if we had a backend, and that will come next.

We are a team of [few programmers](members). The latter started the project, but the former joined recently and has been very influential in the development, especially with the online version.

Our apps will always be free (libre) and open source programs. Which means that anyone can view the code, help improve it, make their own version of it, and distribute either their own version or ours. The reason we do this is because we don't want to have control over your app. We give it to you and give you the freedom to do what you want to do with it. We do not spy on you, we do not restrict what you can do with the program, etc.

Most importantly, we want the programs to honor Jesus through the work we do. Jesus gave us our talents, and we are using them to honor Him.

## Use our Products
You can try out our [online alpha](http://heb12.ml/heb12) if you want. It does not work very well and we are putting a lot of work into making it operational.

Go to the [Heb12 desktop](desktop) page for more information on the desktop program.

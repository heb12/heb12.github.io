# Heb12 Ministries
A project to make a cross-platform Bible system.

Hebrews 4:12:
  For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any double-edged sword, piercing even to the point of dividing soul from spirit, and joints from marrow; it is able to judge the desires and thoughts of the heart.

## About Us
Welcome to the new website for Heb12. Our goal is to make a usable cross-platform Bible system. It will be difficult, but here are our plans.

- Finish our desktop program (complete for use now)
- Make a usable online version (progress stalled)
- Make a backend to our systems that allows synchronization between different devices (developer needed)
- Make an Android app (almost ready for release)
- Make a Windows Store App (not started)

Some of those will require a lot of work and perseverance. We probably will not be able to finish them all, but we will at least make a desktop program and an online version. It would be great if we had a backend, and that will come next.

We are a team of [few programmers](members). MasterOfTheTiger started the project, but the others have been very helpful with the development. @pufflegamerz has done most of the work on the Android application.

Our apps will always be free (libre) and open source programs. Which means that anyone can view the code, help improve it, make their own version of it, and distribute either their own version or ours. The reason we do this is because we don't want to have control over your app. We give it to you and give you the freedom to do what you want to do with it. We do not spy on you, we do not restrict what you can do with the program, etc.

Most importantly, we want the programs to honor Jesus through the work we do. Jesus gave us our talents, and we are using them to honor Him.

## Use Heb12's Bible Apps
We are working on the online version in PHP (progress stalled).

Go to the [Heb12 desktop](desktop) page for more information on the desktop program. 

Go to the [Heb12 Mobile](https://heb12.ml/mobile/) page for more information on our Android app.

## Stay Updated
Here are some ways you can stay updated with the development of our apps.

### GitHub
We have a [GitHub](https://github.com/heb12) setup for our apps. It is where we work and talk about the program. Here you can view the development of the program, study the documentation, and even help us if you want.

### There's Code
MasterOfTheTiger set up a Gitea site at [code.theres.life/heb12](https://code.theres.life/heb12). We will create any new projects there (current ones will stay on GitHub for the time being).

### Mastodon
MasterOfTheTiger often posts information about the progress of the program on Mastodon. You can follow [MasterOfTheTiger on Mastodon](https://theres.life/@masterofthetiger) and/or follow the tag #heb12. If you want a lot of information of development while it is happening, but you are not very technically inclined, this is the best way to keep up with Heb12. 

### Diaspora*
[Heb12 is on Diaspora](https://diasp.org/u/heb12). There we post updates on the progress of Heb12 more often than on any other platform. Either follow Heb12 on Diaspora, and/or follow the tag #heb12.
